FORMAT RULES (follow exactly):

1. HEADLINE: Write a clear headline with year range in parentheses
   Format: [Issue description] ([Year] or [Year – Year])
   Example: "Involvement in his uncle Yang Xiancai judicial corruption case (2008 – 2010)"

2. OPENING SENTENCE: Always start with source attribution
   Format: "According to [article/media type] published by [outlet name] in [Month Year], [subject]..."
   Examples:
   - "According to an article published by Shanghai Securities News (上海证券报) in December 2007, Chen Yuxing..."
   - "According to mainstream media articles in November 2020, Hui's Brothers Currency Exchange Group..."

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
Involvement in his uncle Yang Xiancai judicial corruption case (2008 – 2010)

According to an article published in December 2023, Xu was involved in a corruption scandal involving Yang Xiancai (杨贤才, "Yang"), the former director of the Guangdong Higher People's Court Enforcement Bureau (广东省高级人民法院原执行局局长). Xu, then the chairman of Shenzhen Zhaobangji Group, received CNY 7.5 million (USD 1.05 million) from Yang in exchange for 10% equity in a commercial plaza project in Shenzhen Dongmen (东门) in 2006, which was held by Yang's son Yang Bin (杨彬). The article noted that the funds involved in the transaction were proceeds from Yang's bribery activities.

When investigators carried out asset recovery in January 2009, Xu returned the CNY 7.5 million (USD 1.05 million) and claimed he didn't know the proceeds had been from Yang's illegal gains. No information was found in online research indicating Xu was further investigated or charged in the issue.
